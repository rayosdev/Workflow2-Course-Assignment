For this practical exercise you will be required to automate the assignment that you created for your HTML and CSS course in first year. 

I would advise that you use either gulp or grunt for the automation process. However, if you want to use WebPack you may. 

You may use Sass or Less - that is up to you.



Please copy all HTML files from your app folder to a dist folder.

The Sass or Less should be converted to a .css file and this should be minified.

The images should be compressed from the original size to a smaller size by means of the task runner.

The browser should reload when ANY file is change.
